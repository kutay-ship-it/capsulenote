# Mobile Friendliness Audit (marketing-v3 & app-v3)

## Goals
- Restore onboarding usability on small screens (text + CTA fully visible).
- Make all v3 marketing and app surfaces readable and actionable on mobile without horizontal scroll.
- Keep brutalist aesthetic while tightening spacing, typography, and motion for narrow viewports.

## Problem / Solution / Reason
| Directory / File | Problem | Proposed Solution | Reason / Impact |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| apps/web/components/v3/onboarding/time-capsule-ritual.tsx | Dialog is centered with fixed min height and large padding; no max-height or internal scroll. On phones, content and footer CTAs clip off-screen; skip/back/continue spacing makes primary button unreachable. | Add mobile max-height (`max-h-[calc(100vh-2rem)]`), enable vertical scrolling inside content, and stack footer buttons on small screens with sticky/anchored CTA row. Reduce illustration sizes/padding on `sm` and below; use `text-balance`/clamp on headings. | Ensures onboarding copy and CTA are reachable and readable on mobile, preventing onboarding blocks. |
| apps/web/components/v3/onboarding/time-capsule-ritual.tsx & shared assets | Large decorative capsules/confetti and 3-column step cards push modal width/height; progress/skip area consumes space. | Scale illustrations and confetti counts down on mobile, collapse step cards into a vertical list with compact icon sizes, and move skip into the footer row. | Reduces vertical overflow and visual noise so messaging stays legible on small screens. |
| apps/web/app/[locale]/(app-v3)/layout.tsx + components/v3/nav/* | Header packs credits, write button, and settings into one row; nav links hidden on mobile with no alternative; items can wrap/overflow on ≤360px. | Introduce a mobile nav sheet: collapse credits into a single pill or hide non-critical meters, surface a primary CTA, and provide quick links (journey/letters/settings). Ensure header has responsive gaps and safe-area padding. | Keeps primary actions reachable without overflow while preserving sticky behavior. |
| apps/web/components/v3/letters-list-v3.tsx | Tabs + view toggle are a single non-wrapping row; four tabs + toggle exceed mobile width, forcing horizontal scrolling/cropping. | Stack controls on mobile: first row tabs with horizontal scroll or wrap, second row view toggle; shrink padding/font for `sm`. Add `overflow-x-auto` with scroll shadows if kept in one row. | Prevents hidden tabs and makes filter switching usable on phones. |
| apps/web/components/v3/emotional-journey-v2.tsx | Timeline uses horizontal scroll mapped to vertical scroll with wide (288px) cards and large parallax backgrounds; 600px sticky height can dominate viewport and be hard to navigate on touch. | Add a mobile fallback: vertical stacked cards with simple stepper and minimal parallax; reduce sticky height and horizontal width, disable heavy blur layers on `sm`. | Makes journey digestible and performant on mobile; avoids confusing scroll directions. |
| apps/web/app/[locale]/(marketing-v3)/_components/hero-section.tsx | Headline uses 4xl–8xl text with thick underlines; fixed 300–400px background shapes can overlap text on narrow widths; CTA is single button with long scroll to demo. | Clamp headline sizes (`clamp`), reposition/background shapes per breakpoint, and keep CTA + secondary link visible (e.g., add “See how it works” text link). Ensure scroll target IDs are reachable and add spacing to avoid covered content under fixed navbar. | Keeps hero readable and CTA obvious on small screens. |
| apps/web/app/[locale]/(marketing-v3)/_components/letter-demo.tsx | Editor card enforces large padding/min heights; absolute badges/stamps can overlap inputs on small screens; sidebar settings sit below but controls stay two-column at all widths. | Reduce padding/min-heights on mobile, move badges/stamps into top bar with flex wrap, make sidebar controls single-column and full-width on `sm`, and allow section-level vertical spacing to compress. | Prevents form overflow and keeps fields tappable without zooming. |
| apps/web/app/[locale]/(marketing-v3)/_components/cta-section.tsx | Layered background offsets and large paddings can create horizontal overflow; stats grid lacks mobile width constraints. | Add `overflow-hidden`, reduce offset distances on mobile, and make stats full-width rows or 2-up grid with tight gaps. | Ensures CTA card stays centered and tap targets remain visible on mobile. |
| apps/web/app/[locale]/(marketing-v3)/_components/navbar-v3.tsx | Mobile menu opens full-screen but no scroll lock/close-on-nav in all cases; CTA/link spacing may clip on very short viewports. | Lock body scroll when menu open, confirm all nav links close menu, and add internal scrolling with safe-area padding. | Prevents hidden items and accidental background scroll on devices with small heights. |
| apps/web/components/v3/onboarding/index.ts (provider wiring) | Onboarding modal can reopen immediately after close on hydration; lacks guard to avoid duplicate open on small screens when layout shifts. | Add mount-ready flag and only auto-open once; expose hook to re-open via a small mobile-friendly “Show intro” link in header. | Avoids frustrating reopens and gives mobile users a controlled entry point. |
| apps/web/app/[locale]/(app-v3)/settings/page.tsx & components/v3/settings/* | Multi-column flex rows (status/plan, referral stats) and dense icon badges can wrap awkwardly; tabs + cards can overrun viewport without scroll affordance. | Add `flex-col gap-4` on mobile, shrink badge sizes, and allow horizontal scroll or stacking for tabs. Reduce padding in cards and ensure buttons wrap to full width on `sm`. | Keeps settings readable and prevents horizontal overflow on small screens. |
| apps/web/app/[locale]/(app-v3)/letters/[id]/page.tsx | Detail hero uses wide badges, dual-column metadata, and inline CTAs; timeline card and preview content lack responsive typography; potential overflow of sanitized HTML. | Stack meta rows on mobile, clamp heading sizes, and add `prose` style with safe widths for HTML. Ensure CTA buttons wrap to a column for `sm`. | Prevents letter detail from overflowing and keeps primary actions tappable. |
| apps/web/app/[locale]/(app-v3)/unlock/[id]/page.tsx (and components/v3/unlock-*) | Unlock flow uses split layout and large celebration art; action buttons may sit side-by-side. | Provide mobile stack for illustration/content, shrink art, and stack CTAs with full-width buttons. | Ensures unlock moment is readable and actionable on phones. |
| apps/web/app/[locale]/(app-v3)/credits and credits-sandbox | Tables/card grids for credit history/sandbox can overflow; action buttons spaced for desktop. | Convert to stacked cards on mobile, add `overflow-x-auto` for any remaining tables, and compress padding. | Keeps credit info legible without horizontal scroll. |
| apps/web/app/[locale]/(marketing-v3)/pricing/* (tiers, matrix, FAQ) | Pricing matrix and tier grid are desktop-first; 3-column tables likely overflow; toggles/badges large. | Add horizontal scroll with shadows for matrix, convert tiers to single-column stack on `sm`, and reduce badge/padding sizes. Keep CTA buttons full-width. | Makes pricing readable and actionable on mobile; avoids cut-off columns. |
| apps/web/app/[locale]/(marketing-v3)/landing-v2/_components/* (social proof, features) | Multi-column icon grids and testimonial carousels may overflow or shrink text; large gaps. | Switch to single-column or 2-up grids on mobile with tighter gaps and reduced icon sizes; ensure cards have `w-full` and balanced padding. | Keeps marketing sections scannable on phones. |
| apps/web/app/[locale]/(marketing-v3)/footer.tsx | Footer columns may stack without spacing; links can wrap tightly near legal text. | Enforce column stack with clear spacing and dividers on mobile; increase tap areas for social/legal links. | Preserves readability and tap targets at small widths. |

## Implementation Plan
1) **Triage & size fixes**: Add responsive constraints to onboarding dialog (max-height, scroll, stacked CTAs) and verify with real device sizes (320–414px).  
2) **Marketing polish**: Adjust hero typography/backgrounds, slim letter demo/CTA padding, and harden navbar mobile sheet behavior; test scroll-to targets.  
3) **App chrome & navigation**: Refine app header for mobile (action collapse) and reflow letters tabs; add mobile-friendly journey fallback.  
4) **QA**: Manual pass via browser devtools device emulation (iPhone SE/12/Pixel), plus targeted Playwright snapshots for onboarding modal and letter demo. Capture screenshots before/after for PR.  
5) **Perf/UX checks**: Confirm framer-motion animations degrade gracefully on low-end devices; gate heavy parallax on mobile.  
6) **Regression guardrails**: Add small Cypress/Playwright regression for onboarding modal visibility of CTA and tabs overflow; update docs to mark app-v3/marketing-v3 as canonical mobile experiences.

        "question": "What happens when my letter is delivered?",

        "question": "Can I cancel my subscription anytime?",

      {
        "question": "How secure are my letters?",

      {
        "question": "What's the difference between digital delivery and physical mail?",
        "answer": "Digital delivery sends your letter to the recipient's inbox on the scheduled date. Physical mail prints your letter on premium paper and sends it to your address via trusted carriers."

      {
        "question": "Can I purchase extra deliveries?",
        "answer": "Yes. You can purchase additional digital or physical deliveries anytime, and use them when you schedule new letters."
